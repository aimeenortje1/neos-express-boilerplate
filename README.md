# Neos boilerplate for Node.js/Express projects

It is a boilerplate to quickly get started with your Node.js/Express project. It comes with Mocha/Chai for testing and Eslint to lint your files. It uses *nodemon* to automatically restart the server if the files changed.

Run `npm start` to start the server. Use `npm test` to run your tests. `npm run lint` will analyse your code.
